		<p class="smaller"> The Scratch community consists of all people who use Scratch: kids, teachers, parents, adults, all united under one programming language and online environment. The community began a very small one in 2007 but has grown to an large number of users, turning into millions. </p>

<br> <p class="smaller"> There is a follow button for those who wish to receive updates about the user they will be following. Many users care only about the number of followers they have, although some others do not. </p>

<br> <p class="smaller margin" align="center"> A typical Scratch profile on the website. </p>

<br> <p class="smaller"> Scratch consists of coders (the most common), animators, RPGers, and artists (mostly). </p>

<br> <p class="smaller"> Like many other websites, you can add comments to interact with one another. Scratch encourages positives comments and constructive critism - however, if you post a negative comment you may risk getting banned. </p>
 <br> <p class="smaller"> As of 2015, the Scratch Website had over 10 million projects and counting. </p>
 <br> <p class="smaller"> The people who created Scratch are called the Scratch team. These people usually reach great popularity mainly because they are the people who maintain Scratch. </p>

		<p class="smaller margin"> This is the some of the scratch community explained on the Scratch Wiki: </p>
		<br> <h4> Front-Page community </h4>
		<br> <p class="smaller margin"> There tends to be many users who often get onto the front page as well as many users who often comment on many front-page projects. The front page is not an exclusive community, but thousands of people from all over the world view the projects on it. Whenever many people come together for a common purpose, they form a community, or in this case a branch of a community. </p>
		<br> <h4> Forum Community  </h4>
		<br> <p class="smaller margin"> The forums are used by a minority portion of Scratch users, but those users often become familiar with each other and stick with the forums. The forums are used for large discussions among Scratchers, on related-to-Scratch topics and others. Though small, the forum community has only thrived throughout the years. </p>
		<br> <h4> Wiki Community </h4>
<br> <p class="smaller margin"> The Scratch Wiki contains an extremely small active community of its own. It consists mainly of a small number of users who make frequent edits to pages, debate on issues diligently, as well as laughing and joking around. This small but powerful community maintains what may be the most reliable resource library on Scratch. </p>
