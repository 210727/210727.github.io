		<h2> What is Scratch? </h2>
		<p class="smaller margin"> Scratch is a website that allows users to code their own projects. At the moment, the way you code on Scratch is only based on Javascript. It is like a type of community, as you can interact with other users (e.g. commenting). To join, go to <a href="scratch.mit.edu"> scratch.mit.edu </a> and press "Join Scratch" button at the top of the homepage. On the homepage, you can see other projects users have made. <p> 

		<h2> Project Editor </h2> 
		<p class="smaller margin"> The project editor is where you will be making your project. When you first make a new project, you will see something like: </p>
		<img class="reducesize" src="img/scratch editor.png"> <br>
		<p class="smaller margin"> On the right is a workspace. Down the center of the editor, there will be some colored blocks. You will be able to see other blocks by clicking on the buttons above it, labelled "Looks", "Sounds", "Pen", etc. You can drag any of these blocks to form a code that will play when you press the green flag (next to the title of the project, on the top left). </p> 
		 <br> <p class="smaller margin"> All of the blocks are pretty self-explanatory. For example, the "move (10) steps" block will make whatever is selected (aka. "sprite") move 10 steps forward in whichever way it is pointing in. The "set x to (0)" block will simply set the sprite's x value to 0. However, some of the other blocks can be more confusing and take more work. But we'll come back to that later. </p>
		 <br> <p class="smaller margin" > At the top of the blocks area, there are different tabs, labelled "Scripts", "Costumes", and "Sounds". If you click on "Costumes", Scratch's paint editor will show up. Here, you can upload an image to be on your sprite ,draw your own, or click "Add" at the top of the paint editor and choose from Scratch's library of sprites. When drawing your own, there are two modes: Bitmap and Vector. Bitmap is stored in pixels/squares, while Vector is stored in shapes. On the "Sounds" tab, You will see what music you have kept in that sprite. Different sprites and the backdrops can contain music that can be edited and played. Before any sounds are uploaded (or chosen from the Scratch sound library), there is already the default "pop" sound there. At the top of the audio visualizer (what shows the loudness in the song/sound), there will be the name of the sound/song and  undo/redo buttons. </p>
		 <br><p class="smaller margin">
		 At the bottom of the visualizer, there is something labelled "Edit" and another one labelled "Effects". Using these, you can edit the sound, such as deleting a part of the audio or adding an effect to it, like making the volume softer. Next to the buttons, you can play the sound, stop playing the sound, or record yourself using Scratch. Note that when you record, the entire audio you record on will be wiped out, however, this can be undone. When you navigate back to the "Scripts" tab, the blocks and the workspace will reappear. </p>
<br> <h3> Now to the more complicated blocks. </h3>
         <p class="smaller margin"> Many people often get confused when it comes to the "Variable" blocks. When using Scratch, any round-oval-ish block is a variable. Variables are very useful when it comes to making complicated projects. They can store information, like numbers or some words. You can show the variables on your project stage by clicking the little check box. When you double click them while they're showing on the stage, they will change the way they look, but the value of the variable will not change. Only the look - this means it will not affect the code! </p>  
         <br> <p class="smaller margin"> Another type of blocks that people get confused on are custom blocks. It's very similar to defining a class or ID in CSS, except it's not styling. But if you're experienced with Javascript, it's pretty much the exact same thing as a function! When you press the "More blocks" button, press "Make a block" to make a custom block. These are often used for more complex projects, but can be used for simple ones, too. </p>
         <br> <p class="smaller margin">  1. Enter a name for your custom block. Try to make sure it's understandable, as you will use it (if you want to, but if you don't need it and it won't be helpful at all, don't make it in the first place!) in your coding. </p>
         <br> <p class="smaller margin"> 2. Choose what format you want the block to be and if you want an input (e.g. number input). The input is similar to a variable - it will store information like words or numbers and the custom block will do whatever it is told to do with the variable, but you'll be able to type the value in once you make the block and use it for your coding. For example, if you have "Jump (Height)" (pretend the "(Height)" is a number input aka. variable), then you might define the "Jump" part as: "change y by (height)". In the code itself, you might have "Jump (10)". The 10 will act as the height. </p>
         <br> <p class="smaller margin"> 3. Once you are sure you are satisfied with your custom block, hit "OK" at the bottom of the pop-up! Congratulations! You now have your custom block! :D </p>
         <br> <h2> Paint Editor </h2>
         <p class="smaller margin"> In the paint editor, you can draw and create your own sprites and backgrounds. There are two different modes of drawing: Bitmap and Vector. Bitmap is very pixely and stored in little squares. This type of drawing is more common and very well-known, even outside of the Scratch community. It's like Photoshop, where you can erase and fill your doodles. Vector is different from bitmap. To convert to vector, press the "Convert to Vector" button on the bottom right. Vector is stored in different shapes. In most cases, you draw a random square or circle and use the reshape tool (second button from the top that shows a curved line being reshaped with a mouse) to acheive the desired shape you want to use in your art. You can use the fill bucket to change the color of the shape as long you didn't use the "Pencil" tool and actually draw the lines, but you can still fill in the lines itself. Vector has higher quality (since it's not pixely) than bitmap, however it has its pros and cons, too. For more information on Vector and Bitmap, see these projects:

			<h2> More help?</h2>
			<p class="smaller"> The Scratch Wiki, written by very qualified and trusted users, is a great place to find out new things about Scratch, and so are the Scratch forums. You can find the Wiki <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Wiki_Home"> here </a>,and the forums <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/"> here. </a> If you simply want another introduction to Scratch (the first one being this one, of course xD) you can visit <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/help/"> this </a> webpage. If you need still extra help, you can talk to me on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/chocolatewolf/"> @ChocolateWolf on Scratch! </a> :) Thanks for reading!
